            <!-- Section 1: Partial reprogramming -->
            <section>
                <h2>Partial reprogramming (Yamanaka-factor based)</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most direct "reset" concept: push cells toward a younger gene-control state without
                    wiping their identity.
                </p>

                <h3>A key public result in mammals</h3>
                <p>
                    In very old male mice (124 weeks), a systemic AAV gene therapy delivering an inducible OSK program
                    (a subset of Yamanaka factors) reported ~109% median remaining lifespan extension and better frailty
                    scores versus controls

                <h3>A key public result linked to Altos-affiliated science</h3>
                <p>
                    A 2025 <em>Cell</em> paper describes a broad aging/disease pattern the authors call "mesenchymal
                    drift" across many tissues, and reports it is reversed by partial reprogramming in their models

                <h3>Where humans are right now</h3>
                <p>
                    As of January 28, 2026, Life Biosciences announced FDA IND clearance to begin a Phase 1 study of
                    ER-100 (AAV2-OSK) for optic neuropathies (eye/optic nerve). That is local (eye) and focused on
                    safety first
                    (<a href="https://www.lifebiosciences.com/life-biosciences-announces-fda-clearance-of-ind-application-for-er-100-in-optic-neuropathies/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Biosciences, 2026</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "reset" idea is moving forward, but the human work is still narrow, and whole-body delivery is a
                    very different (harder) problem than "in the eye."
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 2: Why this is still far -->
            <section>
                <h2>Why this is still far from "end aging"</h2>
                <p>
                    To "end aging" whole-body, you likely need <strong>all</strong> of the following to be true at once:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Safe control (dose, timing, shut-off) in many tissues</li>
                    <li>No big rise in cancer risk over decades</li>
                    <li>Delivery that works in the whole body (and can be repeated)</li>
                    <li>Durable functional gains (not just "younger markers")</li>
                    <li>Strong safety in real humans (diverse genetics, comorbidities)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    None of that is solved yet in public human data.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 3: Other approaches -->
            <section>
                <h2>Other approaches that might contribute (but won't "end aging" alone)</h2>

                <h3>Senolytics (clearing senescent "zombie" cells)</h3>
                <p>
                    A U.S. NIA summary of a clinical trial in older women reported only subtle/limited benefits for bone
                    health versus control, despite strong mouse results
                    (<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/senolytic-therapy-shows-subtle-impact-age-related-bone-health-women"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIA, 2025</a>).
                    There are also early human feasibility/safety studies (e.g., D+Q in older adults), but they are not
                    the same as proving big lifespan effects
                    (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(25)00056-8/fulltext"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonzales et al., 2025</a>).
                </p>

                <h3>mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin / rapalogs)</h3>
                <p>
                    Reviews note promising animal data and some early human signals (often immune-related endpoints),
                    but
                    no human trial has shown lifespan extension, and safety/tolerability tradeoffs matter
                    (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12226543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee et
                        al., 2025</a>).
                </p>

                <h3>Metformin</h3>
                <p>
                    Metformin is widely discussed as a candidate "gerotherapeutic," but the human evidence for
                    anti-aging effects is still debated, and definitive trial results for aging outcomes are not in hand
                    (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725001631" target="_blank"

                <h2>Our estimate: highest probability path to "ending aging"</h2>

                <p>
                    The highest probability path is not one breakthrough. It is <strong>longevity escape velocity by
                        layers</strong>:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Buy time</strong> with proven risk reduction (so you stay alive and healthy long enough
                        to benefit from future therapies).</li>
                    <li><strong>Add disease-targeted rejuvenation</strong> (starting locally: eye, skin, joints; then
                        expanding).</li>
                    <li><strong>Stack repair therapies</strong> (senescence control, immune rejuvenation, fibrosis
                        control, better cancer prevention/early detection).</li>
                    <li><strong>Only then</strong> attempt more global "reset" approaches safely and repeatedly.</li>
