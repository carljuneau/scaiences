# Scaiences Style Guide

**Goal:** Write like a scientist, but accessible. Rigorous, clear, and unpretentious.

## Principles

### 1. Clarity beats cleverness
*   Prefer simple words.
*   One idea per sentence.

### 2. Separate evidence from interpretation
*   **Evidence:** What a paper/report shows.
*   **Interpretation:** What we think it implies.
*   **Hypothesis:** What we think might be true, but isn’t shown yet.

### 3. Make uncertainty explicit
*   Use calibrated terms (“may,” “likely,” “insufficient evidence”) only when justified.
*   If you don’t know, say what you don’t know.

### 4. Make claims traceable
*   For every non-obvious factual claim, include a citation.
*   For key decisions, cite both “why” and “how”.

## Structure Rules
*   **Start every major doc with:**
    *   **Goal** (1–2 sentences)
    *   **What we decided** (3–5 bullets)
    *   **What’s next** (1–3 bullets)
*   **Use consistent headings:**
    *   Background → Objective → Methods → Outputs → Limits

## Sentence-Level Rules
*   **Length:** Target 12–20 words per sentence when possible.
*   **Voice:** Use **active voice** unless passive is clearer.
    *   *Good:* “We screened abstracts…”
    *   *Bad:* “Abstracts were screened…”
*   **Avoid stacked nouns:**
    *   *Good:* “dataset to evaluate certainty grading”
    *   *Bad:* “certainty grading evaluation dataset”

## Terminology
*   **Acronyms:** Define on first use, then reuse consistently (e.g., “large language model (LLM)”).
*   **Consistency:** Avoid synonyms. Pick one term (e.g., “certainty of evidence”) and stick to it.

## Numbers and Results
*   **Denominators:** Always include them. “12/30 papers…” not “12 papers…”
*   **Absolute counts:** “12/30 (40%)”
*   **Metrics:** If reporting agreement, specify the measure (e.g., Cohen's κ) and context.

## Citations
*   Cite primary sources (papers, guidelines).
*   For methods claims, cite the guideline (PRISMA/JBI/PRESS).

## Tone
*   **No Hype:** Avoid “revolutionary,” “game-changing,” “solves.”
*   **Precision:** “improves reproducibility” rather than “makes it better.”

## Build-in-Public Norms
*   **Versioning:** Use versions and dates. e.g., `Protocol v0.1 (2026-02-09)`
*   **Changelogs:** Keep a short changelog at the top of protocol files.
