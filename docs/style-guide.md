# Style Guide: The "Accessible Scientist"

We write for a dual audience: **rigorous researchers** and **interdisciplinary builders**.
Our goal is to be scientifically precise without being dry or impenetrable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Rigor without Rigidity
*   **Do:** Use precise terms (e.g., "calibration error" instead of "wrongness").
*   **Do Not:** Use passive voice to sound "academic" (e.g., "It was observed that..." -> "We observed...").

### 2. Synthesize Before You Hypothesize
*   Back claims with evidence or citation.
*   If you are uncertain, state the uncertainty validation method ("We hypothesize X because Y").

### 3. Skimmable Structure
*   Use **bolding** for key concepts.
*   Use bullet points for lists.
*   Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max).

## Writing Rules

| Rule | Bad Example | Good Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Voice** | "The model was trained on X." | "We trained the model on X." |
| **Plain English** | "Utilize," "Leverage" | "Use" |
| **Defining Jargon** | "The model suffers from poor calibration." | "The model suffers from poor **calibration** (it is confident when it is wrong)." |
| **Directness** | "In order to achieve..." | "To achieve..." |

## Tone Check
*   Ask: "Would a smart undergraduate understand this?"
*   Ask: "Would a distinct domain expert (e.g., a biologist reading our ML paper) understand this?"

## Formatting
*   **Headings:** Sentence case.
*   **Emphasis:** **Bold** for key takeaways (don't overuse). *Italics* for emphasis or defining new terms.
