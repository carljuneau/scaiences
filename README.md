# Scaiences

**AI for life sciences research.**

## The Vision

To cure cancer, end aging, and solve biology's hardest problems, we need more than human researchers. We need an **AI Scientist**.

Scaiences is the beginning of our effort to make that happen.

## Phase 1: Certainty

Before an AI can reliably generate hypotheses or plan experiments, it must understand evidence.
Current models are confident, but often hallucinate. Science requires **certainty**, not just confidence.

**We are conducting an overview of reviews (umbrella review) to map the existing evidence.**

> **Synthesize before you hypothesize.**

The field is moving fast, and many reviews already exist. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we are consolidating review-level evidence to separate durable lessons from hype.

Our specific focus:
*   **Consensus**: Where is the evidence strongest?
*   **Evaluation**: Which methods (calibration, traceability) are robust?
*   **Gaps**: What failure modes are consistently reported?

## Contributing

This is an open research project from day one. We are building benchmarks, datasets, and baseline models transparently.
