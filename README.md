# Scaiences

**AI for life sciences research.**

## The Vision

To cure cancer, end aging, and solve biology's hardest problems, we need more than human researchers. We need an **AI Scientist**.

Scaiences is the beginning of our effort to make that happen.

## Phase 1: Certainty

Before an AI can reliably generate hypotheses or plan experiments, it must understand evidence.
Current models are confident, but often hallucinate. Science requires **certainty**, not just confidence.

**We are building an automated tool to grade the certainty of biomedical evidence.**

> **Synthesize before you hypothesize.**

If we cannot reliably grade evidence strength, we cannot safely automate downstream scientific reasoning.

Our specific focus:
*   **Evidence-grounded judgments**: Explicit reasoning for every claim.
*   **Traceability**: Every score backed by citations.
*   **Calibration**: Distinguishing robust findings from weak signals.

## Contributing

This is an open research project from day one. We are building benchmarks, datasets, and baseline models transparently.
